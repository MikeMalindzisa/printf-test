* Write a function that produces output according to a format.

- Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
- Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
- write output to stdout, the standard output stream
- format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
  -- c
  -- s
  -- %
- You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function
- You don’t have to handle the flag characters
- You don’t have to handle field width
- You don’t have to handle precision
- You don’t have to handle the length modifiers
